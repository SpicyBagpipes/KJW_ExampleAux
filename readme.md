# Okay, what do I do?

Head into the [main](main) folder and read the readme in there.

# How best to develop with this example aux.
*This is aimed towards newcomers to GitHub. This is not the "best" workflow, but is simply the easiest way for newcomers to develop on the platform.*

Fork this GitHub project (the "Fork" button just above and to the right of the `<> Code` button). This will create a fork that you will use to update your aux mod.

This means that when the main project is updated, you will be given a "sync fork" option. Syncing the fork will make all macros and such update, without removing your config changes.

To make changes to your fork, navigate to the file, then select "Edit this file". Edit the file accordingly, then select commit changes. This has pushed a commit to your fork. Do NOT create a Pull Request for the main fork for your aux mod.

To build your aux mod, ensure you are still in your fork, then select the green `<> Code` button. Then, select Download ZIP. Extract the ZIP file, then build like a regular addon using Addon Builder.

## What the hell is a .gitkeep file?
These can be safely ignored when building your addon. They are purely so the empty folders are downloadable from the repository.

## I don't want to use GitHub!
That's fine! Simply click the green `<> Code` button, then select Download ZIP to download the repository as a .zip file. Extract this and use it however you like.
